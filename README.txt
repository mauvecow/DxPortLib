DxPortLib is an SDL2 based portability library that is intended to be as
interface compatible as possible with some freely available Japanese game
development libraries.

Originally developed for compatibility with the DxLib game development
library, but now also has partial support for Luna.

DxLib's home page: http://homepage2.nifty.com/natupaji/DxLib/

DxPortLib is designed to work with SDL2/OpenGL and does not use any
system specific functions where possible. Currently actively supported
on Windows and Linux.

As of this writing, SDL2 supports Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, and iOS.
Maintainers for all platforms don't exist, if you would like to help
